# Week 3 - Day 2: Form Submission and Validation

## 🧠 Real-World Scenario
You're building a registration form that validates user input before submitting.

## 🎯 Task
Create a registration form that includes:
1. A required text input for name (must not be empty)
2. A required email input (must be a valid email format)
3. A required password input (minimum 6 characters)
4. Show error messages near each invalid field
5. Prevent submission if any input is invalid
6. Show a success message in the DOM if all fields are valid

## 🧪 Testing & Scoring
5 test cases x 20 points = 100 points total.

## 🚀 Steps
1. All logic and markup are in `index.html` (no separate JS file).
2. Uses HTML5 validation attributes and custom JavaScript for error messages and password length.
3. To test, open `index.html` in your browser and try submitting the form with various valid and invalid inputs.
